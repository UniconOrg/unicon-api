    Model for storing authentication information from external platforms

    Attributes:
    -----------
    - `user_id`: Foreign key that links to the internal user in the system, referencing the `UserModel`.
    - `external_id`: Identifier provided by the external authentication platform (e.g., Google, Apple).
    - `email`: Optional field to store the email provided by the external platform (if available).
    - `active`: Boolean field indicating whether the authentication is currently active.
    - `type`: Enum field representing the external platform used for authentication, based on `PlatformsLogin`.
    - `user`: SQLAlchemy relationship linking the authentication record to the user.

    Relationships:
    --------------
    - `user`: Establishes a relationship with the `UserModel` to retrieve the associated user details.
