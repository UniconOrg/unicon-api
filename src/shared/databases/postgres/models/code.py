    Model for storing verification codes. This model tracks codes generated for users,
    which can be used for various purposes such as password resets, two-factor authentication,
    or email verification.

    Inherits common fields and behavior from BaseModelClass.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    - `code`: The actual verification code (string).
    - `user_id`: Foreign key linking the code to the user it was generated for, referencing the `UserModel`.
    - `entity_id`: UUID representing the entity (e.g., device or session) associated with the code.
    - `entity_type`: Enum field that specifies the login method or entity type, using `UserLoginMethodsTypeEnum`.
    - `type`: Enum field representing the type of code (e.g., verification, reset password), based on `CodeTypeEnum`.
    - `used_at`: Timestamp that records when the code was used, if applicable.

    Relationships:
    --------------
    - `user`: Establishes a relationship with the `UserModel`, linking the code to the corresponding user.
